	<h1>Quickly regarding transport</h1>
	<h2> Use MyCiTi Bus — Best Public Option</h2>

<p>Safe, clean, reliable public transport, especially around the City Bowl, Atlantic Seaboard, Table View, and airport.</p>

<p>Requires a myconnect card (buy at stations), then top it up with money.</p>

<p>Operates on a set schedule and uses its own lanes in some areas = fast during rush hour.</p>

<p>Airport shuttle is a safe and cheap option (R100–R120). 1. Use MyCiTi Bus — Best Public Option</p>

<p>Good for solo travelers, day trips, getting around the city without a car.</p>

 <p>Tip: Get your myconnect card at the airport station or Civic Centre station right away.</p>
	<l1>I've also put some pictures of delicious south african cuisine below. </p>
