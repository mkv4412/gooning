				<h1>About South Africa</h1>
				<p>South Africa, officially the Republic of South Africa, is a country in the southern parts of Africa that borders with Botswana, Lesotho, Mozambique, Namibia, Eswatini and Zimbabwe.</p>
				
				<p>Technologically and industrially, the country is one the most advanced in Africa, and is the second largest economy on the continent after Nigeria.</p>
				
				<p>South Africa is a multiethnic society encompassing a wide variety of cultures, languages and religions. Its pluralistic makeup is reflected in the constitution's recognition of 11 official languages, the fourth highest number in the world.</p>
				
				<p>South Africa is a member of the United Nations, the African Union, the Commonwealth of Nations, the G20, and the Southern African Development Community.</p>
				
				<p>South Africa is a middle-income emerging market with an abundant supply of natural resources; well-developed financial, legal, communications, energy, and transport sectors; and a stock exchange that is the 19th largest in the world.</p>
				
				<p>However, poverty and inequality remain widespread, with about a quarter of the population unemployed and living on less than US$1.25 a day.</p>
				
				<p>South Africa is a member of the BRICS group of emerging economies, along with Brazil, Russia, India and China.</p>

				<h2>Transportation in South Africa</h2>
				<h3>Use MyCiTi Bus — Best Public Option</h3>

				<p>Safe, clean, reliable public transport, especially around the City Bowl, Atlantic Seaboard, Table View, and airport.</p>

				<p>Requires a myconnect card (buy at stations), then top it up with money.</p>

				<p>Operates on a set schedule and uses its own lanes in some areas = fast during rush hour.</p>

				<p>Airport shuttle is a safe and cheap option (R100–R120). Good for solo travelers, day trips, getting around the city without a car.</p>

				<p><strong>Tip:</strong> Get your myconnect card at the airport station or Civic Centre station right away.</p>
